<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>
I am a Master's student at MIT, concentrating on artificial intelligence. I work with Prof. Rivest, in
CSAIL, on research focused on statistics for election auditing. I'm primarily interested in statistics
and optimization related work, with real-world impact. I graduated in 2017 from MIT, with an undergraduate
degree in Computer Science and Mathematics.
